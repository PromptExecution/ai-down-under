# Show Title: "AI Down Under: ...."

## Lifestyle/Technology Show -
	* AI "cognitive machines" are perhaps the most significant invention in the history of humanity, drawing, steam engines, Internet ..  this is significant, I'm certain they want this content they just don't know how to produce it. 
	* we could also go out in the field and show how AI is being used and deployed in Australia & New Zealand, .. possibly anything Southern Hemisphere
	* Inverted Business Model:
		* This will unlock grants, sponsors, etc. 
		* More access to free/discounted spaces (for promotion)
		* TV stations or online platforms may pay for **rights to distribute your content**.
		* License pre-recorded educational or demo segments to networks, schools etc.
		* $5,000‚Äì$20,000 per hackathon/event, depending on size and visibility.

## FORMAT & AUDIENCE
...is the episodic content;  an episode is just 'whats happened'
 what is happening in AI today;  

 Find a network partner .. also let the networks apply for the grants, etc.
 (they're better at this than we are)

 and we're taking the footage and AI editing from the raw form into a podcast 
 and series of episodic segments (Youtube, twitch, etc.); 
 with the FTA tv show being a highlight reel; 
  with a goal of producing 4-12 episodes per year  "AI Down Under"


 It has a distinct regional focus on AI+ML in Australia, Aussie slang & humor.
 It's shot at MLAI Events, possibly other groups (Ruxmon, ACES, ???) as relevant
   - it can cover anything technical not just AI, but that's the central focus

 Our individual moderators are "special correspondents" for the series (credited): 
   -- we might aske them to do a bit of "B Reel", introduction for the show. 
      * introduce date, time, a pan of the audience.
   -- introduce themselves, etc. 
   -- we can also produce a AI/LM moderated podcast with the same raw content
      * sponsors get multiple forms of coverage; podcasts are really easy.

 The episodes DO NOT have a fixed time format; cut to size, 
 made for video on demand (not broadcast), 
 so we're streaming a 30-60 minute based on the topic, it doesn't need to be a fixed
 length when we're doing video on demand. 


## My short list of Presenters:
* I think it should be somebody young & hip and relatable* 
.. these wouldn't be every event, they'd paid a day rate presenting the 
footage against a green screen.   Lots of roles for volunteers.  
We'll use AI upsampling, editing, etc.  .. we could also generate our own Avatar.

## Production Value/Costs:
- - **Runway Gen-2 / RunwayML** ‚Äì AI video editing and effects, automated trimming.
    - **Wisecut** ‚Äì Automatically trims silences, adds subtitles, creates short clips.
    - **Descript** ‚Äì AI transcription-based cutting and rearranging of video.
- - **Magisto (Vimeo)** ‚Äì Uses AI to create short, polished videos from raw clips.
    - **Pictory.ai** ‚Äì Converts long-form content into summarized, shareable clips automatically.

TV stations want **audience engagement, content differentiation, and sponsorship revenue**. 
We need to frame activities in ways that align with their goals:

## **Key Points to Highlight:**

- **Live and dynamic content:** Hackathons and AI learning sessions are visually and intellectually engaging. Live coding, demos, and competitions create drama and excitement.
    
- **Community impact:** Position your group as a hub for tech talent, innovation, and education. TV loves ‚Äúlocal heroes‚Äù stories.
    
- **Target demographic:** Young, tech-savvy, professional, and student audiences‚Äîvaluable to advertisers.
    
- **Exclusive content:** TV stations could get first access to livestreams, recorded sessions, or highlight reels.
    
- **Cross-platform synergy:** Social media amplification, live streams, and post-event content can drive audiences to the station‚Äôs digital platforms.

---

- **Step 1:** Research contacts at each major station (Channel 7, 9, 10, ABC, SBS). Focus on producers, digital directors, and sponsorship managers.    
- **Step 2:** Send personalized emails with a concise deck and links to sample videos.
- **Step 3:** Follow-up with phone calls to set meetings.
- **Step 4:** Offer an on-site demo or livestream experience for decision-makers.

- Highlight how TV can **share sponsorship revenue**, integrate sponsors into livestreams, or co-brand events.
- Consider naming rights for hackathons: e.g., ‚ÄúChannel 7 AI Challenge powered by [Your Group].‚Äù

### **7. Optional: Pilot Proposal**

Offer a pilot segment to show the concept in action:
- A **15‚Äì30 min TV segment** featuring a hackathon challenge, student projects, and AI demos.
- Include livestream integration and short-form social videos.
- This reduces risk for TV stations‚Äîthey see the content before committing to long-term collaboration.

## WHY this is important

* Hackathons should start coming with collectible T-Shirts or SWAG & Proof of Prescence (Crypto)

* Australia is at the intersection of Eastern & Western AI
* MLAI is the largest group in Australia, and probably the largest group in the southern hemisphere

* In December 2025, Australia is set to enforce a pioneering law prohibiting individuals under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms, including YouTube.    This is fine - they already do this in China, it's better - the demand for educational content is going increase. 


Never Robot wars, "Not battle bots" .. never fighting, .. friendly competitions.  racing is okay.  Sydney vs. Melbourne
